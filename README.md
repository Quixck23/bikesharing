# Bikesharing
Analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing. Obtained data from August, 2019, Visualization with Tableau

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
This presentation on seed funding was intended to analyze New York Citibike with data from August 2019. This will serve as a sample for a possible similar project in Des Moines. 
 - How many and who are our potential customers?
- What are the peak hours and why?
- What are the top starting and top ending locations, and why?
- What ages are more eager to use the bike sharing?
- Can we identify the bikes that need repair and calculate possible maintenance?
- What type are they mostly used by gender?
- Trip Duration by Gender?
- User trips by Gender?

## Results:
### How many customer does New York Citibike has and their Gender.
![Potential customers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151508795-eb1e3865-42a0-42db-a26f-9e23345834b1.jpg)

-  From this we can deduct that males are the gender the use bikeshare the most
### Peak Hours

-From this we can deduce is used mostly to commute to work.
### Starting and Ending locations

![Top Startinting Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509117-183a2053-3e15-424c-9d0a-c7d17ea5e840.jpg)
![Top Ending Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509125-59467bb0-f7f5-43e8-b8d1-0c36d507be4c.jpg)

- If we look at the coordinates we can deduce the the the locations where is started and ended the most is near a busy subway near station that come from out of the city.
### Ages using the program.
![ages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509198-9aeb57d1-feb6-4587-ae44-e118b1816cb5.jpg)
- It seems to be a glitch on the system used we can assumed that users from 1980 to 1990 are the Ages the use the most.
### Identification of Most used bikes and how often do they need to be repaired.

![identification of most used bikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509318-59ba165e-20fb-4f91-b63a-a6509e2f60f8.jpg)
![possible maintenance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509323-794c3d84-d206-44f0-875e-1b2fbc23a0e6.jpg)

- From this we can see how quick we can identitfy bikes that we need maintenance soon. 

### What type are they mostly used by gender?

![trip by weekday for each hour male](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509759-86c8d754-cadc-4fe1-bbe0-656bced6dfd6.jpg)
![trip by weekday for each hour unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118587/151509771-aede254f-462e-4936-9ac3-ea0858db2764.jpg)

- From this we can observe that different genders may use the bikes for a different activity besides communting

### Trip Duration by Gender?

-we can onserve that every gender uses the bikes in a range of 20 minutes 


### User trips by Gender?

- We can observe that males subscribers are the largest group of users. 


## Summary:
 - From all these charts, we can assume that the largest group are male users who commute from out of the city, and the busiest hours are 7 AM, which again range from 5pm to 7 pm. Females following the pattern just in less numbers. and following unknown gender. We also found that there was a quick way to find, repair and give maintenance to the bikes.
 - We could also use this data to see how we can do better in Des Moines to close the usage gender gap, and how we could have a plan and improve
 - we can also compare the data for the whole year to forecast repair and maintenance.
 - Also, we could examine specific starting points, provide more bikes, and/or work with the city for future bus stops based on our data. 
  - Comparing over Seasons to observe how are they being used
  - Comparing with weather over weather data.
